# cinnamon-catppuccin-theme


This is a packaged installer release of the cinnamon-catppuccin-theme for Mint Linux.

The theme is not my own making, only the packaging and simplification of installation. All credit goes to LinuxScoop, and the original theme can be found at https://www.pling.com/p/2033080

To install, download the latest Debian package release and install it with the following command.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -f /full/path/to/your/download/cinnamon-catppuccin-theme_1.0.1-1_amd64.deb
```

A reboot or a restart of Cinnamon may be required for some fonts to apply correctly. I have had issues with this, and the automation of restarting Cinnamon seems to fail.
Further development to include the installation and configuration of Glava will follow in later releases.

```bash
sudo reboot
```
